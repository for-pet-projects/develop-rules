# 📦 Develop Rules Release Builder

This project builds a self-contained `.run` archive that packages documentation, branching policies, templates, and other development rules. It supports translation workflows, modular list-based inclusion, and a clear separation of preparation and build stages.

---

## 🖥️ Getting Started

Run the wrapper:
```bash
bash release/run.sh
```

```

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Git
- POSIX-compatible environment (Linux/macOS/WSL)

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Release metadata is defined in [`release/manifest.toml`](release/manifest.toml).

Example:
```toml
name = "develop-rules"
version = "0.1.0"
language = "en"
git_client = "github"
```

---

## 🌍 Translations

- Translations are located in `i18n/<lang>/`, mirroring the source file structure.
- If a translation is missing or outdated, the builder will prompt whether to fallback to the original.

---

## 📄 File Lists

The files included in the final release are defined via `.list` files in `release/lists/`.

- `wiki.list` — documentation and policies (Markdown)
- `templates.list` — additional resources or templates

These lists are processed in order by the builder.

---

## 📦 Output

The generated `.run` file will appear in `output/`

This archive is self-extracting and suitable for use on any POSIX-compatible system.

---

## 🧼 Cleanup

To remove temporary files:
```bash
rm -rf temp/
```

---

## 📌 Notes

- No root privileges are needed
- Designed for portable use across development and CI environments.
- The build system is POSIX-compatible (Linux, macOS, WSL)
