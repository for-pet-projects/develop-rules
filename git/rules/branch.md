# üåø Branching Policy

## 1. Branch Roles and Structure

| Branch Type               | Purpose                                           | Created From      | Merges Into       |
| -                         | -                                                 | -                 | -                 |
| `main[/<version>]`        | Production-ready code, stable releases            | `release`         | ‚Äî                 |
| `dev[/<version>]`         | Active development for upcoming release           | ‚Äî                 | ‚Äî                 |
| `epic/<desc>-#ID`         | Long-running or multi-part feature                | `dev` or `epic`   | `dev` or `epic`   |
| `feature/<desc>-#ID`      | New features or enhancements                      | `dev` or `epic`   | `dev` or `epic`   |
| `bugfix/<desc>-#ID`       | Non-critical bugfixes                             | `dev` or `epic`   | `dev` or `epic`   |
| `hotfix/<desc>-#ID`       | Urgent production fixes (critical)                | `main`            | `main`            |
| `refactor/<desc>-#ID`     | Code/architecture improvements                    | `dev` or `epic`   | `dev` or `epic`   |
| `chore/<desc>-#ID`        | Infrastructure, minor updates (docs, CI, etc.)    | `dev` or `epic`   | `dev` or `epic`   |
| `experimental/<desc>-#ID` | Try-outs, POCs, no merging allowed                | `dev` or `epic`   | üö´ *Never merged* |
| `release/vX.Y.Z`          | Marks a version in `dev` for upcoming release     | `dev`             | `main`            |


> ‚úÖ Use `main/<variant>` and `dev/<variant>` for different release targets (e.g., `main/server`, `main/workstation`, or `main/v2`).  
> If not using variants, just use `main` and `dev`.


## 2. Naming Conventions

- Use **kebab-case**:
  - lowercase letters, numbers, `-`, `/`
  - `#` before issue ID (e.g. `-#123`)
- Avoid:
  - spaces, underscores, camelCase, PascalCase, dots
- `<variant>` can contain dots (`.`)
- Max branch name length: **60 characters**, including prefix/suffix

**Examples**:
```text
main/v2.3.0
dev/legacy
epic/mobile-ui-rewrite-#200
feature/add-login-form-#194
bugfix/fix-memory-leak-#201
hotfix/missing-env-var-#211
refactor/split-db-layer-#202
chore/clean-deps-#220
experimental/svelte-tryout-#310
```


## 3. üîÅ Branch Lifecycle

### üìå Creation
- All branches (except `main` and `dev`) require an issue
- One branch = one issue = one logical task
- Create new branches from their designated base (`dev`, `epic`, or `main` for hotfixes) ‚Äî see the table above
- For each release, create a dedicated `release/vX.Y.Z` branch from `dev` with an empty commit

### üß≠ Daily Workflow
- Merge your parent branch into your working branch at the start of each day

### üí¨ Commit Practice
- Each commit = one logical change
- No direct pushes to `main` or `dev`
  Protect these branches if possible

### Pull Requests
- **Target**: `dev` or related `epic`, unless it‚Äôs a `hotfix`
- Requirements:
  - Use appropriate `PR templates` (location and format may depend on platform or Git client)
  - Required number of `approvals` (e.g., 1‚Äì2) is defined per repository or task policy
  - All checks `(CI, tests, lint)` must pass
  - Use only **`--squash`** merge
  - PR title: `[<branch-name>]`, description must follow the template

### Releasing

Steps:
1. Create `release/vX.Y.Z` branch from dev
2. QA, testing, etc in `release/vX.Y.Z`
3. In `release/vX.Y.Z` : 
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin release/vX.Y.Z
```
4. Open a PR: `release/vX.Y.Z` ‚Üí `main`

Branch Protection (Recommended):
- No direct pushes to `dev` and `main`
- Require 2 reviews
- Require all checks to pass
- Release branches (`release/vX.Y.Z`) **must not be deleted** after merge.

### üß© Devlog Generation

You can generate a development changelog between two releases by comparing their release branches:

```bash
git log release/v2.4.0..release/v2.5.0 --pretty=format:"- %s"
```

### üî• Hotfix Process

1. Create from `main`:  
   `hotfix/<desc>-#<issue-id>`
2. Fix, test, open PR to `main`
3. Tag with: `Hotfix vX.Y.Z <desc>`
4. Then open `bugfix/<desc>-#<issue-id>` to port into `dev`

### üßπ Cleanup

- **Local**: delete merged branches within **24h**
- **Remote**: delete within **7 days**

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Clear branch types with strict naming rules
- One branch per issue
- Reviews and CI mandatory before merge
- Only squash merges
- Branches must be cleaned up after merge, except `release`

> üîí **Policy applies to everyone** ‚Äî developers, admins, integrators ‚Äî no exceptions.
